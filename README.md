# Ode to an awesome advisor
We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- seeing everybody on campus is fun
-  I got to play broomball last weekend and catch up with the guys

## Crappies

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
- I turned in an assignment 15 min late and got a 0 for it
